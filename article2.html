        <h2>WHAT IS DESIGN?</h2>
        <p class="body-text">When I started to work as a UX Designer, I had an interview to join a company that was developing a lot of public services web portals, to help them create smooth interfaces with my visual design knowledge that I gained studying graphic design. And my answer to the question “What is Design for you?” was “Design is solving problems”, I got convinced that the drive of Design is truly understand a problem, and with lots of thinking mechanisms find a solution that would be made with all the real context from its users. And I think sometimes we forget that we always did this, without calling it design, we just gave it a name later when we noticed that we found a thinking pattern to help us evolve. 

            <p class="body-text"> While I was working as a UX Designer, I was finishing a Design degree, and had a lot of theory classes, where we discussed a lot what Design meant. And I changed my perception of what it really is, not that I no longer think that Design is not solving problems, but refined my answer. “Design” originates from the word “*[designō](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/designo#Latin)*” or disignare which is a latin word that means develop a plan, for example draw a building structure and all the plans for construction. In Portuguese “designing” is “projectar” or “desenhar” and it is a verb that means the act of making a project, but “desenhar” most used meaning is drawing. 
            </p> 
            <p class="body-text">We can say now that what we defined as design is the act or the process to approach a specific topic, issue or missing solution, referring to requirements to be satisfied and conditions to be met to be solved. It can be a plan to build an artifact, or a system, by comprehending the purpose of the artifact and who is going to use it, to decide how the auctions and structure will be. This is only possible because we evolved in a very curious way, our minds are able to learn, and to save information and we have literature, lots and lots of saved knowledge, that helps keep our hunger for evolve more and learn more about ourselves and our surroundings. With this we created a big resource that we have mostly available in our hands on our phones, but on libraries and schools too. We created the ability to research, to go find what we need to know, and so Design is finding that way, that path to discover the solution. Using a more recent example for context Designing an interface should be just the end of a design process, or cycle, because design is not drawing some beautiful accessible interface. Design is discovering how to decide how it will end up being, and more importantly why.
