        <h4>WHAT IS DESIGN?</h4>
        <p class="body-text">When I started to work as a UX Designer, I had an interview to join a company that was developing a lot of public services web portals, to help them create smooth interfaces with my visual design knowledge that I gained studying graphic design. And my answer to the question “What is Design for you?” was “Design is solving problems”, I got convinced that the drive of Design is truly understand a problem, and with lots of thinking mechanisms find a solution that would be made with all the real context from its users. And I think sometimes we forget that we always did this, without calling it design, we just gave it a name later when we noticed that we found a thinking pattern to help us evolve. 

            <p class="body-text"> While I was working as a UX Designer, I was finishing a Design degree, and had a lot of theory classes, where we discussed a lot what Design meant. And I changed my perception of what it really is, not that I no longer think that Design is not solving problems, but refined my answer. “Design” originates from the word “*[designō](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/designo#Latin)*” or disignare which is a latin word that means develop a plan, for example draw a building structure and all the plans for construction. In Portuguese “designing” is “projectar” or “desenhar” and it is a verb that means the act of making a project, but “desenhar” most used meaning is drawing. 
            </p> 
            <p class="body-text">We can say now that what we defined as design is the act or the process to approach a specific topic, issue or missing solution, referring to requirements to be satisfied and conditions to be met to be solved. It can be a plan to build an artifact, or a system, by comprehending the purpose of the artifact and who is going to use it, to decide how the auctions and structure will be. This is only possible because we evolved in a very curious way, our minds are able to learn, and to save information and we have literature, lots and lots of saved knowledge, that helps keep our hunger for evolve more and learn more about ourselves and our surroundings. With this we created a big resource that we have mostly available in our hands on our phones, but on libraries and schools too. We created the ability to research, to go find what we need to know, and so Design is finding that way, that path to discover the solution. Using a more recent example for context Designing an interface should be just the end of a design process, or cycle, because design is not drawing some beautiful accessible interface. Design is discovering how to decide how it will end up being, and more importantly why.
        </p>
    
        <h4>DESIGNER THEN VS NOW </h4>
        <p class="body-text">Since the beginning of human civilisation, human beings always tried to solve problems, it. No matter what kind of situations we face, we adapt and evolve with those problems, it’s what made us evolve so quickly. From finding how to set up a fire, to generate electricity we evolved this much because we had questions, needs and problems to solve. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">t’s not that old, that we have “Designer” as a professional title. We used to call the people who solve daily human problems, a craftsman, an artisan, an engineer or other professional activity that implies to know the people who will use what you are developing, and create objects that were truly useful like swords or benches, technology that will mitigate this needs. The creators had to learn from their parents or by having masters to teach them how to work with rock, iron or wood, and start to make pieces that would be used for years. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">Designers dominate the art of concept, and create objects with a purpose for the daily life of human beings. With time passing, and the evolution of technology, things got a little different. First of all, working as a designer got a way easier with all the tools and information available, since the Industrial Revolution we changed the way we produce objects and even technology, and the craftsman evolved too. By the time we had machines working for us, helping us making products faster, it came the real need to change the paradigma of Design. Therefore it started to be a discipline, and a case study, with Product Design, Industrial Design and all the different areas of Design that already existed, got a new position on the market and in the eyes of people. The importance of the role that is responsible for asking the right questions and find the insights that truly change the world, and apply that knowledge in solutions. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">Even though a Designer had to know a lot of specific techniques like carpentry or iron forgery in the beginning of the century, the professional was often confused with an artist or a producer of goods. 

            The production of design objects, started to focus on all users needs, unlike in ancient times that most of the work done was for the high classes of society and an acclaim to ostentation, we already had people working on dat-to-day problems, looking at real people needs if you think about a carpenter who made benches for people to have lunch or a forgery who made knives that helped hunters to catch preys. This are all examples of design applied to common objects that we see today as simple daily life utilities. But these people needed to think about who will use it and how, just like a UX designers should do today with a website.
            
            To focus on the Design history, since Bahaus that product development got a lot different, we found working methods and development methodologies that helped everybody to be involved in the product conception, from manufactures, sales representatives to the real users. Designers started working with a lot of different areas that needed a new way of thinking and a disruptive methodology, to help think outside the box, like banking systems, hospitals, schools and all this different areas where a fresh pair of eyes was needed.
            The development of a product started to become a clear process, transversal to all areas of design, with different tweaks. We managed to find 5 points that are common to all projects, even though people call them all those different names, Designers usually get through all this points no matter if they are doing a costume or a bench. And this process is very similar to what’s used by architects and engineers. This processes helps organisations around the world and across multiple markets to evolve and create their vision and their impact on society.

            Today, with all the failing from our design ancestors, we learned an iterated a lot on how we deal with problems. From clothing industry to architecture or healthcare, all of them have similar processes to deal with issues in their work. And now we have a good design processes, that are getting even better and more versatile, depending on the area. But all of them have this structure as a baseline: first of all, **research**, the most important party of the process (at least for myself) where we understand the problem and all the contours around it. And it is a step that never stops until the end, mostly because we need to be always researching, the problem, then what other solutions, then experimenting the solutions that we prototyped and then track how its being used. Next step will be the **definition of the problem**, with all the research done about the problem and context about the users, we can define exactly what we want to solve (if not get back to research) and we can state how we will solve it, to make prototypes. This is crucial in a Designer work, **prototype** and develop visual examples of your ideas that allows testing with real users before spending more time and money on its development. You can measure feasibility, usability and in some cases **test**, to understand if the product is valuable and really solve the problem or problems that we discovered in the begging of the process. This is not a sequencial process, but it’s easier to follow this order, to organize and plan your work, and to maintain focus on each step. If needed we can always get back to the previous, or if unfortunately you don’t have much time you can skip a phase or do it more quickly, it’s not the best practice but in the real world sometimes it happens. So flexibility is an advantage that designers have to add value to their creations.
            
            All these processes and methods are tools to be used and create an environment of highly competent professionals. Nowadays, in the digital era, we see Designers as “do-it-all” people. A designer is hired as an User Experience specialist, for example, and find himself doing a little bit of everything, from print to the Marketing team to MRECS to the Human Resources, all of this between designing a User Flow for an internal software or client. All these examples actually happened to me, when I started writing this article. Apart from being tiring, and destructive to the Designers mind, the more you know about all these design disciplines, the less specialist you become. And this can not be Designers fault, and much less of their strong need to learn more. 
            
            Even though by trying and experimenting designers find what they like and their talents, as these are two totally different things, you never get excellent in none of the areas you are working at. And you might be needed in things that you don’t even like to do. You might be talented on visual design, but you might like to do interviews and learning directly with your users. So after 3 years doing a bit of everything I found what I like and what I’m more talented doing. And this is a big help defining my career and what I want to do with it. Working in this environment of doing a bit of everything is not ideal to grow and to make a career, and I was fortunate enough to change to a bigger organisation where I have the space and the support to learn and be effectively better in a specific area. In this case UI and then product design. With a cross functional team, with designers from all the different areas, like research, content or writers, ui and product designers, all working together with the same goal to make sure that our users have the best experience possible. And I don’t need to be covering holes anymore. Not that I don’t like learning new things, but we need to make sure we are responsible for our work, and for that we need to know what we are doing. And now when I need to make research I’ll make sure I have the help of a fellow researcher that is a specialist in that area.
            
            In this multi-disciplinary area, the main challenge is to focus on what you want to do, and never forget what your talents are, as they will give you a big help growing. Because this way is much easier for you to find a way to add value to your customers, peers and the products you are working at. And if you are lucky enough your talent might be what you actually love to do.
            
            The hard part of working in this new very fast evolving world of technology, as a designer is very overwhelming to keep learning and tracking all the things like testing or prototyping, that are needed to be very good at what you do. Being a full-stack designer in the long run will get you a lot of challenges, but if you apply your design thinking logic they might become cool opportunities. Doing an end-to-end design process gives you the helicopter view of what’s needed to develop a product. Makes you aware of the challenges a researcher have or a visual designer and helps you create empathy for your peers. And that’s the most important thing in design. Understanding what are the pains of your colleagues and how can you help them surpass them. But you will be better for sure focusing on one or two areas, and cooperating with other designers, like a puzzle where all of us are pieces that make the picture almost perfect. 
            
            Designers need to work with other designers, to get better, to help each other grow and to fill in the parts that are missing on the other side. So there’s not a correct way to grow and create your path in the design world, but for sure there are ways to help you through the process. 
            
            **Ask for feedback**
            
            **Be mindful about others perspective**
            
            **Keep reading and learning from others**
            
            **Don’t focus only on what you know**
            
            **Design needs collaboration more than ego, and there’s nothing wrong with being wrong since you learn with it**
